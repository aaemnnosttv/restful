**Warning:** This project is at a very early stage. Treat it as an experiment, and understand that breaking changes will be made without warning. The sky may also fall on your head. Using wp-rest-cli requires the latest nightly build of [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), which you can install with `wp cli update --nightly`.

Project backed by [Pressed](https://www.pressed.net/), [Chris Lema](https://chrislema.com/), [Human Made](https://hmn.md/), [Pagely](https://pagely.com/), [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) and many others. [Learn more â†’](http://wp-cli.org/restful/)
